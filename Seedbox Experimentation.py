    Through the total 59721 users, 44886 were assigned to the control group and 14835

    The first question is basically a conditional probability.
    we want to find out the probabilty of at list 1 REBILL transaction given that the user must call-in to cancel.

    Between the 44886 users that were aasigned to the control group,
    941 users generated at least 1 REBILLwhich is almost 2% of them.
    Between 14835 users that were assigned to the test group, 1556 users generated at least 1 REBILL
    this is almost 10.5% of them.
    As a result a user that must casll-in is more likely to generate REBILL
